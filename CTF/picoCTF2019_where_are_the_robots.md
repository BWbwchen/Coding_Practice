# where are the robots

check the source code first, I find selector 'flag' in css file. 

try to change its color to that it visible, but it doesn't work.

## hint
hint say : What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## robots.txt

check [this](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en)

A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.
