In brief, you can't use `/bin/cat` anymore QQ

## solution 
we can't use cat because it is not builtin command in shell, so can we use the builtin command to print out the content of flag ? Unforturntely I didn't find any command QQ

But ! If we look in the builtin command of shell, we can find an interesting command `command`! 

```
The  command  utility  shall  cause the shell to treat the arguments as a simple command

âˆ’p        Perform the command search using a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to
          find all of the standard utilities.
```
Bingo ! just use `command -p cat *`

## murmur

It is toooooo hard to find a little command in such huge man page...
It take half day to find that .... without any hint ...
